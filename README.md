# My-BST
My Binary Search Tree. This project reinforced the concepts of designing dynamic data structures and algorithms used to insert/remove elements.

The following methods I created for the project.
- insert()
- remove() **
- get()
- findMaxDepth()
- findMinDepth()

I also added some helper methods and traversal methods that I thought would be a nice touch.
