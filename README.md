# My-BST
My Binary Search Tree. This originally was an assignment for CS250. I got a grade of 4.7/5.

This was a very important assignment to me however because it really expanded my knowledge of dynamic data structures and allowed me to create my own.

I was responsible for creating the following methods (Every method was worth a point):
    - insert()
    - remove() **This is where I got points taken off. I had missed two cases but I believe I have covered those now. If not feel free to debug, I would really appreciate the help.
    - get()
    - findMaxDepth()
    - findMinDepth()

I have added some helper methods and others I thought that would be really useful.
