# My-BST
My Binary Search Tree. This originally was an assignment for CS250. I got a grade of 4.7/5.

This was a very important assignment to me however because it really expanded my knowledge of dynamic data structures and allowed me to create my own.

I was responsible for creating the following methods (Every method was worth a point):
- insert()
- remove() **
- get()
- findMaxDepth()
- findMinDepth()

I have added some helper methods and others I thought that would be really useful.

**This is where I got points taken off. I had missed two cases but I believe I have covered those now. 
- Case where successor is immediate right child of the node we want to remove
- Case where the node we want to remove has one child
If not feel free to debug, I would really appreciate the help.
